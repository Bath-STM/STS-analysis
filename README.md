# STS-analysis

Scripts to analyse spectroscopy data.

## Directory structure

It is currently envisaged that analysis scripts to be run are placed in this top level directory. Should the need arise there could be further dirs required, to segregate by project (but it is hoped scripts will be more generally useful).

Figures output by analysis and plotting scripts should be placed in the `figures` dir (but not comitted).

Data for analysis may be kept in the `data` dir (but not comitted). Its suggested that data is kept in subdirs named by date (and maybe work package down the line)
